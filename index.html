        <em>"Only in silence the word,
        only in dark the light,
        only in dying life:
        bright the hawk's flight
        on the empty sky"</em>
        -Ursula K. Leguin, "A Wizard of Earthsea"

        This is a quote from my favorite book. It speaks on
        balance. I belive that balance is the most crucial
        part of a persons life and as I get older the more
        I understand and appreciate this.

        I am 31 years old and I live in Austin, Tx. I have 
        spent the last 10 years playing drums and working for 
        Little Guys Movers, a furniture moving company. I have 
        been lucky enough to travel all over the world playing music.
